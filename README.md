* IxN Hackathon 2017
* 10/16/2017 - 10/17/2017
* Won People's Choice Award

* Problem: We have a dozen conference rooms, but with 200+ employees in the main office, it is very difficult to find open conference rooms for meetings.
* Idea: Create a website that lists out all booked events when specifying a date and time range, with the output ordered based on likelihood of swap/cancellation availability.
* Solution: Created a website that allows one to find all booked events for conference rooms with contact information of the organizer available to contact requesting for a swap or cancellation. The events were listed in order of likelihood of conference room time slot becoming vacated upon request.
* Worked On: The planning of the project and the UI/UX of the web page.
